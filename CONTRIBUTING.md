# First Off

Thank you for considering contributing to this project ðŸ˜€. I have one goal for all of my projects, and that goal is to teach people how to write simpler, easily understood code so a non-technical individual can understand it. For example:

1. I write my code in a certain way on purpose, because I found that it makes it easy for the brain to filter out and understand.
2. In JavaScript code, I use "let" rather than "const" to avoid confusion. I want people to focus on the article or example, not my reasons for using "let" here, or "const" there. 
3. I use as few variables as possible on purpose, again to avoid confusion. 

# What I Believe In

1. Making everything as simple as possible, so everyone understands. 
2. Frameworks force you to be organized; they don't teach you how to be organized.

# Childish Code

Code should be understood even by a child. Write simple to understand code. Avoid writing obscure code that can only be understood by you. Be mindful of other people, and repectful of their time.
