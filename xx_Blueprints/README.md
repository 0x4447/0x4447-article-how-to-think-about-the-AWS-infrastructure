# Blueprints

A good frame of reference and a clear first explanation of what the AWS services are is not the only thing missing. The Blueprints to create somethign usefull with all the Lego blocks is also a serious omission, becasue not ony your are dropt in a uknown world with uncelar rules and full of lies, no body is evenwillign to help you build the things they promise you, you can do easilly. 

With my Bluepritns you should be able to build your infrastruture with a good understanding of what you are doing. 

Once you'll udnerstand this Bluepritns, wel wi'll focuso on automation with a click of a button ðŸ˜‰.
