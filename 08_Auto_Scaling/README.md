# Understandign Auto Scaling the right way

AWS Auto Scaling is one of thoes things that actualy is fairly straight forward to understand and work with, but AWS fails to explain the relation betwen the `Launh Configuration` and the `Auto Scalign Group`. Let see if we can do better.

# The General Idea

The idea of Auto Scaling is to have multiple servers with the same exact code and configuration for two main reasons:

- redundancy: one server goes down, the other can still process incommign requests
- spread the load: instead of upgardgin one server to a bigger one you spread the load among multiple servers

To take advantage of this feature you'll alos need a Load Balancer, but more on this in the next sectin.

# Auto Scalign Group dose all the work

In the `Auto Scalign Group` configuration is where you specify how AWS should handle your setup. You cna speficy the minimum ammount of server and the maximum allwoed, you cna specify how the healt of a server should be monitored, how many AZ do you want to use etc.

The `Auto Scalign Group` is the one responsabile to spin a new EC2 server if a server is not reachable, or the app that should be run on the server is not respondign anymore becasue maybe it crashed. If that happens, the `Auto Scalign Group` will spinn more EC2 instances to preserve the minimum ammount of server that we specifyed in the configuration. 

But to work the `Auto Scalign Group` needs to know how to configure the EC2 servers, and this is where the `Launh Configuration` comes to play.

# Launh Configuration brake down

An `Auto Scaling Group` can't exists wihout a `Launh Configuration`, thus the later needs to come first. In this section is where you create a configuration that will be used by `Auto Scaling Group` to create new EC2 instances. The prcoess of creating a `Launh Configuration` is very similar to when you Launch a new EC2 Instance. With the difference that you have to name the `Launh Configuration` etc. You get to specify the following:

1. Choose AMI
1. Choose Instance Type
1. Configure details
1. Add Storage
1. Configure Security Group
1. Review

As you can see this is the identialc setup for a EC2 Instacne, and as you can see from the 3th option, we have access to the `Configure details` where you can specify the `User data`! Meaninig you can reliebliy make EC2 cloens indentical to each other.

# Edit Launh Configuration and update all the EC2

Let say you need to make a chagne in the `Launh Configuration` and updated all the EC2 that were created with the original configuration by the `Auto Scaling Group`. Turns out that this is straigth forward and cool onces someone tells you how to go about it (Wait... am I gettign excited ðŸ¤”). 

### Make a Launh Configuration copy

When you visit the `Launh Configuration` menu, you have the chance to make a copy of a specific configuration (you can't edit them dirrectly). When you start makign a copy, you'll have the chnce to name the new configuration, I always append `- V1` to keep track how many edits did I do, and which one is the latest version. 

Then in the 3th tab you can as always edit your `User data` to the new script that you did. Once you are done, you just save the new `Launh Configuration`, and this is step one.

### Update the Auto Scaling Group

The `Auto Scaling Group` have very limited edits options. But one important thing you can edit, is the active `Launh Configuration` to be used when creatgin new EC2 Instances. This means that you select the Group you want to change, select edit, and chagne the `Launh Configuration` to the latest version you made, and save.

Now, notign will happen, all the active and workign EC2 Instance will keep on workign, to apply the new configuration, you'll have to termiante the EC2 Instances. When you do that, the `Auto Scaling Group` will detect that the Group doesnet have the minimum ammount of healty servers, and will start to spin new ones. As you can imagin, it will start new EC2 servers based on the new configuration that you made.

This givews you the option to terminate every EC2 at once, or update the group by termianting one server at the time. It is up to you how you want to go aobut it. 

# Amazing End

As you can see this part is actually fairly cool, and works well once you udnerstand how to trully go about it :).

# Befroe we go to CodeDeploy

There is a big chance that you just had an idea to just use the `User data` section to automatically deploy your coce right? You could wrtie a Bash file that would:

- updated the package manager
- install all you need
- grab the code of the proejct from GitHub, S3, FTP you name it
- configure the projet
- start it 

You are right, this would be one way of doign it in the simplest form.

The down side of this aproach is that the developers won't and should not have access to the EC2 instacnes. They should be writign code, and not managing servers, but if we belived that then this aproach is not perfect.

The idea of CodeDeploy is to use the special configuration file that a develoepr adds to the proejct to tell CodeDeploy waht to do. Whichi intiles anywah writign Bash Scripts ;) so we solved nothing in essenc. 

But I want you to understand this difference, which is sattle, nobody talsk about thus create confusion. Meaninig if you are happy with the `User data` section, just use that and be happy. If you or someoen alse on top of you wants to do it the Hispter way, then you'll have to learn how to do it the CodeDeploy way.

# Step by Step Setup

The result of the previous steps can be reused in your AutoDeployment, where the followign one needs to be repeated for each project you want to deploy. Meaninig let say you have a micro-servcie infrastructure, you'll have to repeate the followign steps for each micro service. Or to put it even in a differetn way, you'll have to repeat this step for each repository you have on GitHub.

The idea of the cloud is resiliance, and the ability to spin multiple servers with the same code, so the load can be split across multiple machines. In this setup we are going to have aminimum of two servers (always) thus we need a load balancer which will split the traffci betwen the servers that are gogin to be atacched to it.

### Launch Configurations

As you learned before from the Env Variable section. A Launch Configuration allows you to create identical EC2 instances, based on what is specified in such configuration. A LC must be created if you are going to use the Auto Scaling featire. 

A thing worth nothing, is that a Launch Configuration can be reused and applayed to different Auto Scalign Groups. This should help you name a LC in a way that will make more sense to you. Since as with AWS, most of the time you can't reneame somethign once you created it.

**IMPORTANT**: The first time you go through this setup, AWS will give you a wizzard that will help you create a Autoscalign Group with the Launch Configurations since for some reason one can't live without the other - it is romantic, but as the Load Balancer show, two things that works toghether can also be crated on their own and just be.

**The setup to create a Launch Configurations - Wizzard**

1. Go to the `Launch Configuration` section in the AWS EC2 page
1. Click Create Autoscalign Group
1. Go to the next section
1. Select the System Image that you would like you server to start from
1. Go to the next section
1. Name the Launch Configuration. I always append ` - V1` so I know which version I'm at
1. Make sure you select the `IAM role` to the one that we created in the previous section
1. If you want to add some `User data` you can expand the `Advanced Details`. Find the code to past [here](https://github.com/davidgatti/How-to-think-about-the-AWS-infrastructure/blob/master/xx_Blueprints/01_CodeDeploy/00_GitHub%20to%20AWS/user_data.sh), and don't forget to check the [Env Varaibles](https://github.com/davidgatti/How-to-think-about-the-AWS-infrastructure/tree/master/xx_Blueprints/00_ENV%20Variables/00_the_basics#the-misterious-user-data-section-in-ec2) section to find out more about `User data` if you didn't read it already.
1. Go to the next section
1. Add how much storgae you'd need
1. Go to the next section
1. Select a `Security Group`
1. Go to the next section
1. Check if evrythign is OK
1. Click `Create launch configuration`
1. Select the SSH Key

After this point you'll imediatly see the `Auto Scaling Group` page since we are in the Wizzard mode

### Auto Scaling Group

This is where you define how many EC2 Instances you would like to have with the exact same configuration. Based on for example a minimum number of servers, CPU load, Traffic in/out or based on waht the waht is seat to a specifci Load Balancer. This means that you can for example say, that you want a minimum o 2 EC2 Servers. This means that AWS will created 2 servers and apply the Launh Configurations that you have selected, and will alwasy keep a minimum of 2 EC2 Instances.

**The setup to create a Auto Scaling Group**

1. Give it a name
1. Set the group size to a minimum of 1 for now
1. Select a VPC
1. Select the subnet nettworks that you used in the `Load Balancer` section
1. Go to the next section
1. Keep the default selection
1. Go to the next section
1. If you want (I recomend doign it eventually) you can have the Autoscalign Grup send you and email everytime a servers gose down and a new one is created in its place.
1. Go to the next section
1. Set tags
1. Go to the next section
1. Click `Create autoscalign group`
