# What is a EC2

This is the easiest part of AWS, where a EC2 is just a fancy name for a regular server/computer. There is nothing fancy here or magical. The only thing to remember is that this are virtual machine, meaning Amazon uses one real computer and then runs many virtual servers, so they can more effciently use real hardware.
