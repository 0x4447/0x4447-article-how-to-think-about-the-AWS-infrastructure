# How to think about the AWS infrastructure

---

Still 🚧🍺 Work In Progres...

A biggest omission in documentations in general is the frame of reference, a story, and explanation that will help you better understand a complex idea. Some very simple truth, that you can build on top of.

If you were to check all the other articles and project that I have on [GitHub](), you’d see that I try to give that to you. My hope is that I’m doing a good job of it.

# The frame of reference for AWS

Now day we need two frame of reference, because over the years AWS accumulated a huge amount of lies on things that are just not true

## The lie Amazon tells us

Everywhere you watch, read and talk to will tell you that AWS is amazing, everything is automatic, scales indefinitely, and is just few clicks away. This is complete nonsense, and the sooner you realize this the sooner you'll understand that you have to put all the peaces together yourself, write code and create configurations files to make it all work automatically and automagically, as advertised.

## Lego blocks

You have to think about AWS like Lego bricks scattered all on the floor with no instruction what to do with them. You have documentation for each individual pace, but no guides or tutorial with ideas what could you created with all this peaces. The most special of you might say that there are tutorials out there done by AWS people. But the reality is that either there were written 5 years ago, and the AWS interface alone changed drastically since then, or the steps now are different and nobody bothers updating those tutorials. I argued a lot with AWS Tech Support and they always came back to me telling me the will notify the author to updated those posts, but nothing ever happens.

If a tutorial is not working for you, the problem is not with you, it is with the tutorial itself.

# Take your time

It is hard to for our minds to let go of a previous truth. It takes a lot of energy, and our minds don’t like to waste it. But in this case, you need to make the switch if you want to enjoy using AWS. Because AWS have lots of flexibly and you can build very cool things. But to do so. You need the right mind set, and AWS never did a good job at it.

Once you think you are ready jump in to all the different topics, and see what is really possible and how to achieve what was false advertised to us.

# The Structure of this repo

Each folder will contain a self contained tutorial of a specific AWS feature, to help you focus on on thing at the time. Be patient and take your time, because AWS is time consuming.

# In the end

My hope is this. If I managed to explain how to handle the AWS lies, and you accepted this truth. Then you should be able to do anything with AWS, since it is a powerful platform, and the documentation is good, once you stop looking for the magical button that will to everything for you. The documentation tis in the lego logic, you get a detail explanation of the part that you are dealign with, but don’t look for a general instruction that will tell you how to put it all together.
