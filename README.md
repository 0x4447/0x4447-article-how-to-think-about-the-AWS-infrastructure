# How to Think about the AWS Infrastructure

One of the most important and common omissions in documentation is a frame of reference, a story, an explanation that will create a better understanding of a complex idea. This should be a very simple truth that serves as a foundation on which you can build.

If you were to check out all of my articles and projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/davidgatti), you‚Äôd see that I try to provide that. I believe it's the most important piece of information I can offer.

If you leave that out, and you mislead and lie to your customers, you'll have a recipe for misery and pain. In this article, I'll focus on demystifying all of the lies that AWS tells you, and I'll provide you with a better frame of reference for understanding what AWS has to offer.

# The Lies Amazon Tells Us

Whether you're watching a video, reading, or talking to someone face-to-face, just about everyone will tell you that AWS is amazing. Everything's automatic, it scales indefinitely, and it's all just a few clicks away. But this is complete nonsense, and the sooner you realize that, the sooner you'll understand that you have to put all of the pieces together, write the code, and create the configuration files to make it all work automatically and "automagically", as advertised.

# Lego Blocks - The Lost Frame of Reference

AWS is a lot like Lego bricks scattered all over the floor, with no instructions on what to do with them. There's documentation for each individual piece, but no blueprint or tutorial on putting the pieces together. The most skeptical among you might say that there are tutorials out there. But the reality is that those tutorials were probably written five years ago, and the AWS interface has changed drastically since then. The steps are different now, but no one's bothered to update the tutorials. I've argued with AWS Tech Support, and they always respond that they'll notify the author to update the posts, but nothing ever happens.

If a tutorial is not working for you, the problem is not with you, it is with the tutorial itself.

So remember...Lego blocks.

# Take Your Time

It's hard for our minds to let go of previously held truths. That takes a lot of energy, and our minds don‚Äôt like to waste energy. But you need to make the switch if you want to enjoy using AWS. AWS is quite flexible, and it enables you to build very cool things. But you need to have the right mind set, and AWS never really created that.

When you decide that you're ready, jump into all of the different topics. Explore the possibilities and learn to achieve what was falsely advertised to us.

# The Structure of this Repo

First things first! I put this list in this order on purpose. I designed it this way because I believe that it's the most effective way to go about learning the AWS ecosystem. Back to the Lego analogy, the blocks are scattered on the floor, and nobody tells you where to begin. 

The first goal of this article is to reach a point where we can accomplish one thing AWS promises, and that's to truly autodeploy code around the world. After that, we'll continue to explore what AWS has to offer. So, all folders that start with "x" are secondary, and not crucial to the basic AWS functionality.

# In the End

My hope is this: If I manage to explain how to handle AWS' lies, and you accept it as the truth, you should be able to do everything you want to do with AWS. It's a powerful platform, and the documentation is good once you stop looking for a magic button that will do everything for you. The documentation will give you a detailed explanation, but don‚Äôt look for anything that will tell you how to put it all together.
