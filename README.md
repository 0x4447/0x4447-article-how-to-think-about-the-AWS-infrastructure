The biggest ommision in documentation is the frame of reference and if you check my GitHub profile you'll see that I alasy try to build one first before I dive in to the nitty gritty details. Whoever write documentation thing that we develoeprs or SYsAdmisn will eventually understadn how to use whathever is thronw at us. True, but why wastign time commign up with a freme of reference which will start wrong and have the wrogn asumtpion before you'll have osmethign that make sesne. When the expert in that topic could save us so much time and frustration. We are not telepatic, and if you luck telepaty as I do, then this guide should help you understand how to go about AWS. Since I spend the past 6 months wrappign my head around this whole infrastructure. 

# The lie Amazon tells us

Evrywhere you watch, read and talk to will tell you that AWS is amazign, evrythign is automatic, scales idefinetly, and is just few clciks away. This is complete nonsesne, and the sooner you realzie this the sooner you'll understand that you have to put all the epaces together, write code and create configurations fiels to make it all work autoamtically and automagicaly, as advertised.

# Lego blocks

You have to think about AWS like legos bricks scatered all on the floor with no instruction what to do with them. You have documentaiton for each individial pace, but no guides or tutorial with ideas what could you created with all this peaces. The most sceptial of you might say that there are tutorials out there done by AWS people. But the reality is that either there were wrtien 5 years ago, and the AWS interface alone chagned dtrastically sicne then, or the steps now are different and nobody bothere udpatign thoes tutorials. I argued a lot with AWS Tech Support and they walsy came back to me teelgi nthey will notficy the outor to dupate thoes posts, but nothign never happend. 

If a tutorial is not workign for you, the problem is not with you, it is with the tutorial iteslfe. 

# Structure of this repo

Each foder will contain a self contained tutorial of a specific AWS feature, to help you focus on on thing at the time before we end up buildign a full fledged solution. Be patient and take your time, becasue AWS is time consuming.
