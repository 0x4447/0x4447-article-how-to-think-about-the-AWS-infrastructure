# CloudTrail

This tool is a very nice debugging tool. Normally SysAdmins will turn this feature on to see what is happening in the AWS infrastructure, since you can see, who loved in, who created a EC2 instance, who deleted a RDS database. Hence the name Trail. 

Another benefit of this logging is that API calls from outside will be logged here, making much easier to debug integrations such as GitHub pushing a notification to CodeDeploy. And for example you might see that the credentials are wrong, etc.
