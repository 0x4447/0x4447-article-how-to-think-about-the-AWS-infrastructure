# CodeDeploy

Yes, CodeDeploy the biggest lie that AWS spreading in all its marketing materials, the idea that you can just push a commit to GitHub and magically it will be deployed to all your servers - AHAHAHAHAH - thats all I can say. Good luck finding the magic button or setting.

The reality is that CodeDeploy is just a an app and service by the same name that AWS did. This application needs to be installed on each server you want to deploy your code to, and you need to configure it in a way that will work for you.

Because of all the lies that AWS feeds you the picture that they painted is that it is simple, straight forward and you just can enjoy looking at the servers getting the latest code. Where in reality there are a myriad of steps that you have to take to make this whole thing works.

Because of this we need to keep on learning about all the AWS lego blocks before we can event think to start using CodeDeploy.

Lets move to the next section, and lets keep learning about our legosâ€¦
